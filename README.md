# WIP!!


# FrSkyAntennaTracker

Open source Arduino based FrSky SmartPort compatible RC Antenna Tracker. Uses GPS and Barometer SmartPort telemetry to calculate Azimuth and Elevation angles and apply them in a closed loop with a Magnetometer sensor for Azimuth and an Accelerometer sensor for Elevation. 

Developing for the moment!!
